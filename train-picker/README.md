# train-picker

A full Clojure webapp using Compojure and Enfocus for Clojurescript rendering. Uses the [BART JSON API] (bart.crudworks.org/api) to tell me which station to head to in the morning. Also gives me the weather in SF or Berkeley if I want it.
Please do not use this to stalk me. Thanks!

## License

I've got a license. A license to drive. To a BART station. Or walk if it's not raining, I guess.
